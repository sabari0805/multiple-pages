    <p>Crayon Shin-chan made its first appearance in 1990 in a Japanese weekly magazine called Weekly Manga Action, which was published by Futabasha. Due to the death of author Yoshito Usui, the manga in its original form ended on September 11, 2009.</p>

    <p>Yoshito Usui died on September 11, 2009, after a fall at Mount Arafune. After Usui died, Futabasha originally planned to end Crayon Shin-chan in November 2009. Upon discovering new manuscripts, Futabasha decided to extend the comic's run until the March 2010 issue of the magazine, which shipped on February 5, 2010.[9] Although the series formally ended on February 5, 2010, it was announced on December 1, 2009, that a new manga would begin in the summer of 2010 by members of Usui's team,[5] titled New Crayon Shin-chan</p>
    <h2>Reception</h2>
    <p>As of 2015, the original run of the Crayon Shin-chan manga has sold over 55 million copies, while the New Crayon Shin-chan manga has sold over 3 million copies, surpassing 58 million copies between both, making it one of the best-selling manga series.[78] Including game books, encyclopedic books and other related material, the figure amounts to 148 million.[79] As of March 2021, Bandai Namco has sold 227.02 million Crayon Shin-chan Chocobi food packs.</p>
    <h3>Controversies</h3>
    <img src="./shinchan solo.jfif" alt="">
    <p>A Hindi dub of the anime has aired on Hungama TV in India since June 19, 2006.[81] There were complaints from parents over the main character's behavior and the attitudes exhibited towards elders on the show, both of which were seen as a negative influence on children.[82] The series was banned in October 2008 by the Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting on account of heavy nudity.[83] After many requests from fans, a heavily censored version with the adult jokes (like Shin-chan making fun of his mother Misae's small breasts), scenes of nudity (like Shin-chan revealing his buttocks & genitalia and Misae breastfeeding Shin-chan's infant sister Himawari) and references to those particular aspects of Japanese culture which are incompatible with Indian culture (like consumption of beef & pork by the characters, Shin-chan's father Hiroshi regularly drinking beer for recreation & references to dating due to Indians' preference for arranged marriages) edited out in order to be more family-friendly to the Indian audience started airing on Hungama TV from March 27, 2009</p>
